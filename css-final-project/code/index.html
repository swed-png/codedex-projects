          hey, i'm @swed ✿˖°.
          <br/><br/>
          As of the day I am writing this, I started studying html and css less than two weeks ago. 
          It has been fun and I keep learning new things.

          I have always liked doing creative things, ever since I was young. This interested bloomed through drawing lessons I took as a child, as well as through the essays I wrote throughout my school years, among others. 
          <br/><br/>
          After watching a few experiences <i>(and a few dramas with programmer main leads)</i>, I ended up eager to learn more about programming and the different languages possible.

          <p>
            Before being interested in programming, I had always been quite into the visual aspect of things, which led me to commmunication and design at first. 
            <br/><br/>
            I was part of a fashion association in school, and was in charge of everything related to communication, including the creation of visuals, which i quite enjoyed.
            Hence, most of my projects back then where focused on visuals.

          <h3>Introduction</h3>
          <br/>
          <p>
            My first real introduction to programming was the association's website. I had to take care of it, and it was new to me. 
            I had never really seen how one could build a website before then.
            <br/><br/>
            It did not include programming per se since it was built with Wordpress, but it made me wonder what goes on behind the scenes. 
            Surely, it opened up in me some form of curiosity for that field.

          <h3>Discovering CSS</h3>
          <br/>
          <p id="third-project-text">
            Ever since high school I <i>did</i> know a bit about programming from mandatory Python classes, but I was not really interested back then.
            A few years later, I specialised in computer science for one semester, after my first time handling a website. 
            <br/><br/>
            But my first time trying something else than Python was at an intership I took last summer. Although I was only briefly introduced to CSS, it felt like a whole new world opened up to me. 
            Similarly to the website I handled in the past, since it was with Wordpress, I only took care of the visual aspect really. But I <i>did</i> have to use CSS classes when I could not control everything myself. 
            In these cases, the programmer was the one who <i>actually</i> wrote down the code for me.
            Unfortunately, he did not really teach me how to do it myself, and did not give me access to everything that went behind the website's visuals, other than the Wordpress itself. 
            <br/><br/>
            Through this intership, I had almost full control over the website's look, since I had to build it from the ground up, but once again, it was all with Wordpress. 
            It felt satisfying to choose everything myself for that website, and I was glad they trusted me with the entire appearance.

          <h3>Hands-on Project</h3>
          <br/>
          <p id="fourth-project-text-1">After everything, I decided to try to actually learn coding, by starting with web programming. 
            By taking lessons, I get to practice with real exercises, which helps me learn a lot faster and understand the concepts more easily.
            <br/><br/>
            The first project that I worked on -- and that used both HTML and CSS -- was part of the CSS course I am taking. 
            I chose to make a website for an exhibit that I enjoyed.

            This exhibit was especially my style visually and the posters for it also fit into the kind of art I personally like and enjoy creating.
            <br/><br/>
            That said, it only felt right to spend a lot of time on making it as visually appealing as I could.
            Since it was my own project and not many people would see it, I decided to do everything according to my taste, which made it really fun, yet challenging, since I am quite the perfectionist.
